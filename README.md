<h1 align="center"> Hi there 👋 </h1>
<h2 align="center"> 🔧 Architecting Scalable Backends with FastAPI & PostgreSQL </h2>

I'm **Tiberius Mairura**, a backend systems engineer and technical leader focused on designing resilient, well-structured platforms in real-world environments. My current stack centers around **Python (FastAPI)**, **PostgreSQL**, and DevOps-ready architecture using **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and infrastructure-aware design patterns.

I currently lead engineering efforts for production-grade healthcare systems, having built robust onboarding engines, RBAC-powered APIs, intake form platforms, and dynamic scheduling logic from the ground up.

---

### 🚀 What I Do

- Architect backend systems with **clean, scalable architecture** using FastAPI
- Design RESTful APIs with strong authentication, rate limits, and webhook support
- Write integration-ready services that align with infrastructure (K8s, CI/CD, Docker)
- Translate complex system needs into well-tested, maintainable code
- Advocate for backend clarity: **“Clean systems earn user trust.”**

### 📌 Currently Working On

- 👨🏾‍⚕️ Backend systems for a multi-role healthcare platform  
- ⚙️ Infrastructure-aware microservices with FastAPI and PostgreSQL  
- 📩 Modular email workflows (Jinja2 + background tasks)

---

### 🧠 Learning + Sharpening

- Distributed systems design  
- AWS / GCP integration patterns  
- DevOps practices at production scale (ArgoCD, Terraform, CI orchestration)
